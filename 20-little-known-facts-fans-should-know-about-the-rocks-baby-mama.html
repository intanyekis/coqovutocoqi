He’s been called “The Great One”, “The People’s Champ”, and “The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment.” He’s taken over Hollywood and is one of the highest paid actors. He’s been a well-known celebrity since his days in the WWE and is now&nbsp;one of the most recognizable names in the world. There isn’t a person in the world that doesn’t know the name The Rock. He’s a household name and every detail about him is known. His family history, football days, WWE career and transition to a major film star are well documented. However, he keeps his personal life private and rarely speaks about it. Behind every great man, there is a great woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rock is currently in a relationship with Lauren Hashian and they have two daughters together. Hashian isn’t in the spotlight like her significant other and she tries to stay low key. She is very supportive of Johnson but she also has her own career. Some people only know her as Rock’s girlfriend, however, she’s been living the Hollywood lifestyle far longer than he has. Hashian is a star in her own right and is known in parts of the world. Here is a look at 20 Little Known Facts Fans Should Know About The Rock’s Baby Mama.</p><h2 id=lauren-comes-from-a-famous-family><strong>Lauren&nbsp;Comes From A Famous Family</strong></h2><p>Dwayne Johnson’s father, Rocky Johnson, also competed in the WWE and was one half of the first African-American team to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. Rock’s grandfather, Peter Mavia, was also a legend in his day. Johnson’s cousins all entered wrestling as well, most notably current Raw Women’s Champion Nia Jax. Johnson wasn’t the only person born into a famous family.</p><p><strong>Lauren Hashian comes from a famous family as well. Her father, Sib Hashian, was the drummer for the legendary band Boston. He joined in 1975 and performed on their debut album, Boston, which featured the iconic single “More Than A Feeling.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He left the band in 1980 after being replaced by the original drummer. He continued to perform music for the rest of his life. Sib suddenly died at the age of 67 on March 22, 2017. He collapsed during a performance on the Legends of Rock cruise. Johnson posted a pic to Instagram and wrote, “Being on stage, in front of adoring fans, friends and family. Keeping the beat one last time. Your passing in this manner is extremely poetic and somehow beautiful. Thank you for the many life lessons you've taught over the years. Grateful. We love you Sib. We miss you.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>)</p><h2 id=lauren-s-a-talented-musician><strong>Lauren's A Talented Musician</strong></h2><p>The Rock went from the CFL to the WWE to Hollywood. He’s always been a performer but on several different platforms. Johnson followed his father and grandfather into the wrestling business. However, Lauren Hashian has a similar story. Hashian’s passion has always been music and that’s partly because she was born into it. Hashian followed in her father’s famous footsteps to become a singer-songwriter.

He has an undeniable charisma and charm that is captivating. He commands the spotlight and casts a large shadow. During his time in the WWE, he took the spotlight from several major stars and became a worldwide sensation. He continues to steal the spotlight in all of his film roles. The Hollywood Reporter said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“He’s become one of the best parts (if not the best part) of the Fast and Furious franchise over the last decade.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheHollywoodReporter</a>) He's a powerful force in front of the camera, hosting award shows and on social media.</strong></p><p>Lauren Hashian stays out of the spotlight and prefers it that way.

She isn’t as active as she once was and rarely posts these days. At one point she was posting backstage pics from award shows and videos of her daughter. She isn’t very active on Twitter and hasn’t posted anything new since late 2017. However, since the birth of her second daughter, she has returned to posting more regularly on Instagram. Regardless, it pales in comparison to The Rock’s output.</p><h2 id=lauren-s-mother-was-a-playboy-bunny><strong>Lauren's Mother Was A Playboy Bunny</strong></h2><p>It’s a well-known fact that Dwayne Johnson comes from wrestling royalty. The story of how his parents met has been told many times. His father, Rocky Johnson, was a successful wrestler who married into the world famous Samoan wrestling family, the Anoa’i family. He married the daughter of legendary wrestler “High Chief” Peter Maivia, Ata. Rocky met Ata after he teamed up with her father in a few tag team matches.

Despite Playboy’s notorious reputation, the elegant club had a strict no nudity and no touching rule. The club was open from 1977 to 1982 and was located in the same building as the offices of the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys were frequent visitors of the club. In fact, the Bunnies developed a rivalry with the world famous Dallas Cowboy’s Cheerleaders. One Bunny said, “They were jealous of us. You could do a job that paid $15 a game or $300 a night. You pick.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thesportster</a>)</p><h2 id=rock-s-success><strong>Rock's Success</strong></h2><p>The Rock&nbsp;transitioned from being a superstar wrestler to being a major Hollywood star easily.

He once said, “We do these stories and we talk so much about the business end, the success end, but then Lauren isn't mentioned and my daughter isn't mentioned. I always like making sure we find the balance and my home life is in there and Lauren Hashian is in there and my daughter is in there.” He notes that without the right partner all of his success might not have happened.

He added, “I pulled over and looked at my messages and had a moment where I just caught my breath. We said a prayer right then to give his daughter strength — because we had talked about our daughters. That's what we would talk about. Both of us were divorced, and we talked about the power of being a dad and the strong connection of a dad and his girl.

Initially, there was a story in the Washington Post that speculated on his chances of winning. It suddenly turned into a major story and was covered by media outlets. There was even talk of him running in 2020 but that seems unlikely due to his schedule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>He said, “Realistically, as we go into 2018, when you look at my slate as we’re developing and shooting into 2019 and 2020, the slate goes deep into 2021, so it feels like the realistic consideration would be 2024.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>)</strong></p><p>There has even been some talk that if Johnson ran he could win. If he did run and was victorious that would make Hashian the First Lady. She has been successful in every role she’s taken from building a recording studio to releasing her own music.
